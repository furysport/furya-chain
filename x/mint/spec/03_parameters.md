Below are all the network parameters for the `mint` module:

- **`mint_denom`** - Token type being minted
- **`genesis_block_provisions`** - Amount of tokens generated at the block to the distribution categories (see distribution_proportions)
- **`reduction_period_in_blocks`** - How many blocks must occur before implementing the reduction factor
- **`reduction_factor`** - What the total token issuance factor will reduce by after the reduction period passes (if set to 66.66%, token issuance will reduce by 1/3)
- **`distribution_proportions`** - Categories in which the specified proportion of newly released tokens are distributed to
  - **`grants_program`** - Proportion of minted funds to grants program account
  - **`community_pool`** - Proportion of minted funds to be set aside for the community pool
  - **`usage_incentive`** - Proportion of minted funds to usage incentive account
  - **`staking`** - Proportion of minted funds to pay staking incentive
  - **`developer_rewards`** - Proportion of minted funds to pay developers for their past and future work
- **`grants_program_address`** - Address to receive gran program tokens
- **`usage_incentive_address`** - Address to receive usage incentive
- **`team_reserve_address`** - Address to receive team reserve tokens
- **`weighted_developer_rewards_receivers`** - Addresses that developer rewards will go to. The weight attached to an address is the percent of the developer rewards that the specific address will receive
- **`minting_rewards_distribution_start_block`** - What block will start the rewards distribution to the aforementioned distribution categories

**Notes**

1. `mint_denom` defines denom for minting token - ufury
2. `genesis_block_provisions` provides minting tokens per block at genesis.
3. `reduction_period_in_blocks` defines the number of blocks to pass to reduce the mint amount
4. `reduction_factor` defines the reduction factor of tokens at every `reduction_period_in_blocks`
5. `distribution_proportions` defines distribution rules for minted tokens, when the developer
   rewards address is empty, it distributes tokens to the community pool.
6. `weighted_developer_rewards_receivers` provides the addresses that receive developer
   rewards by weight
7. `minting_rewards_distribution_start_block` defines the start block of minting to make sure
   minting start after initial pools are set
