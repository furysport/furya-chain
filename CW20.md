This steps are based on https://docs.junonetwork.io/smart-contracts-and-junod-development/tufuryal-erc-20

1. Compile wasm

Clone erc20 contract in RUST and compile it. The result is `.wasm` file.
Take an example of erc20 contract from here - https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/erc20

2. Upload wasm

Upload compile wasm contract to the chain.

```
furyad tx wasm store cw_erc20.wasm --from validator --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ -y
```

This command will return a code number which starts from `1`.

3. instantiate

Create a contract from uploaded wasm. This will use the code number generated at upload step.

```
furyad tx wasm instantiate 1 'instantiate message' --amount 50000ufury --label "furya erc20" --from validator --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ --no-admin -y

furyad tx wasm instantiate 1 '{"name":"Nxtpop Coin","symbol":"NPOP","decimals":6,"initial_balances":[{"address":"pop1...","amount":"12345678000"}]}' --amount 50000ufury --label "furya erc20" --from validator --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ --no-admin -y
```

This command will return a contract address.

4. query contract

Query contract info by address. Use above generated contract address to check contract info.

```
furyad query wasm contract "contract address"

furyad query wasm contract pop1.....
```

5. query balance

Query balance of an address. At first, try to check the address with initial balances.

```
furyad query wasm contract-state smart "contract address" '{"balance":{"address":"user address"}}'

furyad query wasm contract-state smart pop1... '{"balance":{"address":"pop1..."}}'
```

6. transfer cw20 token

Transfer cw20 token to an address.

```
furyad tx wasm execute "contract address" 'transfer message' --from initial --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ -y

furyad tx wasm execute "contract address" '{"transfer":{"amount":"amount","owner":"from address","recipient":"receiver address"}}' --from initial --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ -y

furyad tx wasm execute pop1... '{"transfer":{"amount":"200","owner":"pop1...","recipient":"pop1..."}}' --from initial --chain-id testing --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.3 -b block --keyring-backend=test --home=$HOME/.furyad/ -y
```

Try to test balance changes after transfer using `furyad query wasm contract-state smart` command in step `5`.
